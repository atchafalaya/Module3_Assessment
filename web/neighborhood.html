		<h1>My Neighborhood: Fightingville</h1>
			<div>
				Fightingville is one of the oldest parts of Lafayette. While difficult to define exactly, the boundaries of Fightingville correspond roughly with the more officially named "Mills Addition".</p> 
               <p> The Mills Addition was the first subdivision added on to the heart of the original settlement of Vermilionville, around the time of the Civil War.
                <p>
                Fightingville gets its name, as legend has it, because it was an area at the edges of the settlement beyond the notice of the law where people would go to settle their differences.

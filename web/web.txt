"How does the internet work? What happens when you click a link?"

When you click on a link, a request is sent from the computer you are using to a separate computer or server with much larger memory and processing power. 

This request uses a method, or algorithmic style of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol to either send information, retrieve information, or have data processed and the result returned for action by the web page.

The four methods of requesting covered so far include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
GET is a simple request for data from the browser to the server.
POST sends new information to the server for action.
PUT creates a new node of information where specified.
DELETE removes information.

Three of the request types are idempotent, meaning they are independent of other requests, do not affect the state of the server, and are self-contained. Only POST is not idempotent.

The most common responsed types are Hypertext Markup Language or HTML, Javascript, Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, Javascript Object Notation or JSON, and image files.

HTML contains instructions on how to render a page within the capabilities of HTML.
Javascript contains code to be executed locally.
CSS are instructions on how to layer styles atop the HTML.
JSON are data sets to be used by Javascript.

HTTPS is the most common protocol, permitting encrypted communication from end to end along the path between server and browser.

Javascript relies on the large memory and processing power of modern client-side computers like desktops and laptops to host a certain amount of executable code on the client computer. This code executes relatively simple instructions locally, saving bandwidth and increasing speed.
